# planet-hunting
Queen Mary and Tower Hamlets College project.
planet hunting with Python.
QMUL prepared some sample detrended light data from Keplar.

We wrote some code to phase fold the light curve.
Basically superimposing each dip on top of one another to get a higher resolution image.

From this we can determine the ytransit time of a planet crossing a star.
We know the solar radius of the star and the gravity at the surface. 
Therefore we can use all this info to determine properties of the planet and its orbit.

We are writing programs that calculate the orbit or inclination of the planets etc based on our readings from the light curve. 

Check out Keplar section on NASA website.
Check out Astronomy at QMUL.

I'll update with names and links and more code when we have it.
